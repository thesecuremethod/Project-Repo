# Project-Repo
And now were finally here and ready to start tearing into this stuff. Go team! 

Master Project List: 

1. A native iOS app. 

2. A native Android app. 

3. A decently cool web application that will have a userbase. 

4. A linux configuration script

5. A patchwork of different systems integration exercises using new security technologies. 
for example: 
https://www.aquasec.com/
https://www.tcell.io/
http://bluetalon.com/

6. An exercise of using the full stack in this chart: https://www.latitude.work/trends/july-2017 consisting of the top examples in each class. 
7. An exercise in using C#, WMIC, Active Directoty and Windows PowerShell in some cool hacky way. 

8. Oh yeah.. and update the website so that it has some cool stuff on it. Art inspiration: Lets get some top art in the form of two graphics: An archer with an arrow ready to fly but the arrow is a giant key with a decryption algorithm depicted. The other side of the page will be a visual depiction of a data store or application ( maybe just a computer ) with a large keyhole and some panicked on-lookers. 

9. Oh Oh yeah.... there was this weather API exercise that I started in Starbucks with Dan... got to finish that.... 

10. The Paramiko implementation ( installed locally ~/Documents/pingScript/ ) for pulling Std.out from a network host. ( Using ping to test home network uptime/downtime and provide SMS alerts from a remote testing host) 

11. Redeploy site on AWS. 

12. Fork the macOS privacy/security implementation by drduh here: https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/blob/master/README.md and chart my progress through following the guide.
